# GOV Wireframing

A drag and drop tool to enable users to create a wire-frame for an online government service.

To use this tool you can drag and drop various elements from the left hand side on to the main canvas to build up your wire-frame.
* Preview will allow a user to see how the wire frame would look.
* Download will allow a user to download the html mark-up to recreate the wire-frame in html.

This tool is still being worked on there are currently only a few elements available to create a wire-frame:

* Grid Layouts
* GOV Header
* GOV Footer
* Alpha Bar
* Beta Bar
* H1 (Title)
* H2 (Sub title)
* Paragraph
* Button

All elements need to meet the [GOV UK elements guide lines](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/#guide-typography).
